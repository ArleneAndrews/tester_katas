The now-official repo for test exercises, so I don't have my code to share. PRs with small test exercises welcome!

## Hello World
- Go to a shopping site
- Choose a product tag
- Add all items on the first page that have that tag
- Be a good citizen and empty the shopping cart before leaving

## Let Me In!
- Visit simple log-in site (maybe https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)
- Enter username
- Enter password
- Click on button

## Popup clicking
- go to a site that has an entry ad
- wait for the popup(s) to load
- click them to access the main page

## Wrong Direction!
- go to a site that has multiple items
- wait for the site to load
- click one item
- return to the main page by clicking the back button

## Find the button
- go to a shopping site 
- locate all of the buttons (add item, search, etc)
- Don't forget the drop-downs!
